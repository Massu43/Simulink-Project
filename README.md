Bioreactor Model Simulation Using Simulink
Process Control Lab Project â€“ CH331

Simulated and analyzed a nonlinear bioreactor system governed by inhibition-based biomass and product dynamics.

Modeled system behavior in MATLAB Simulink under open-loop conditions with step disturbances and noise.

Performed linearization and identified first- and second-order transfer function models using fmincon optimization.

Evaluated performance via MSE/RMSE metrics; best RMSE for biomass: 0.1229 (2nd-order model).

Designed and tuned PI and PID controllers using direct synthesis and auto-tuning methods for both setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection.

Demonstrated effective control through simulation of closed-loop servo and regulatory responses.
